tmux can be controlled using a prefix key (by default, Ctrl-b) and a command key. The command key to split into two panes is %. From within tmux:
Ctrl-b %

We can split our second pane horizontally:
Ctrl-b "

To switch to the next pane (panes are numbered left-to-right, top-down):
Ctrl-b o

A step in context above panes are windows. Windows behave similarly to tabs in a browser.
When tmux starts up, it gives you a window and a single pane inside the window.
To create a new window:
Ctrl-b c

tmux will switch to the new window automatically. You can see the new window indicated in the status-line. Windows are numbered from 0, so our new window is number 1.
Now you can create panes and treat this window like we did before. We can even create another window. Our three windows are numbered 0, 1, and 2.
To move to the next window in the index:
Ctrl-b n

To move backwards in the index:
Ctrl-b p
